# Predator-prey simulation

Loosely based on https://github.com/edouardrolland/Boids_Simulator

### Required packages

numpy (tested on 1.26.3)
pygame (tested on 2.1.0)
pygame-widgets (tested on 1.1.5)
PyAutoGUI (tested on 0.9.54)

### How to run

Execute by running main.py
This executes a single simulation by default.

For running the Evolutionary Strategy algorithm the show_simulation() function call needs to be commented and execute_ea() needs to be uncommented in main.py (line 40)
